					Hello, my name is Laurence. I am a Junior Software Developer who's
					very passionate about creating beautiful seemless experiences for
					users and delivering the best product you can dream. I enjoy thinking
					about lots of possibilities so that the software delivered exceeds
					expectations.
				</p>
				<p className="py-6 sm:py-4">
					My focus is on creating solutions for clients that exceed their
					expectations. I love getting things done and building products that
					help people and communities. Continuous learning is incredibly
					important to me and one of the main reasons I entered into this field.
					I love building projects in my spare time to help me learn new things
					and to continue becoming a better developer.

				<p className="py-6 sm:py-4">
					When I'm not behind the computer trying to find the best way of doing
					something, you will find me... hiking outdoors, playing soccer with
					friends, snowboarding and immersing myself in movies!
